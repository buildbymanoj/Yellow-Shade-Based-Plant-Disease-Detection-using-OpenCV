# Yellow-Shade-Based-Plant-Disease-Detection-using-OpenCV
This project uses a webcam feed and computer vision techniques to detect and classify possible plant diseases based on yellow coloration in leaves. It identifies potential Nitrogen Deficiency, Fungal Infection, or Potassium Deficiency by analyzing the HSV color values from the live camera input.
# ðŸŒ¿ Yellow Shade-Based Plant Disease Detection using OpenCV

This project uses a webcam feed and computer vision techniques to detect and classify possible plant diseases based on **yellow coloration** in leaves. It identifies potential **Nitrogen Deficiency**, **Fungal Infection**, or **Potassium Deficiency** by analyzing the HSV color values from the live camera input.

## ðŸ“¸ Features

- Real-time plant leaf monitoring using a webcam.
- HSV color threshold tuning with interactive trackbars.
- Disease classification based on yellow shade analysis:
  - **Light Yellow** â†’ Nitrogen Deficiency
  - **Dark Yellow** â†’ Fungal Infection
  - **Bright Yellow** â†’ Potassium Deficiency
- Image enhancement using CLAHE for better detection in low-light conditions.
- Morphological operations to improve mask quality.
- Visual feedback: bounding boxes, color values, and disease label overlayed on detected regions.
